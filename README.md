# Blog Post Example

This was generated via the AWS CDK.  It's a super simple repo for demo purposes and was used in a blog post: https://dev.to/martzcodes/token-authorizers-with-apigatewayv2-tricks-apigwv1-doesn-t-want-you-to-know-41jn

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
